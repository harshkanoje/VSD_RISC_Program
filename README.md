	<summary>Day - 1 Intro to Verilog RTL and Sysnthesis</summary>

 ## Basics
 Understanding Simulator an cmd terimnal prompts
 
 Simulator--> Making framework adhering to required specs
 Testbenched --> to apply stimulus to design to check its functionality

from both these, we obtain a VCD file which can be visulaized using GTK Wave

 Synthesizer --> Tool for converting RTL to Netlist

# Workflow Steps
## 1. RTL Synthesis

Input: RTL (typically Verilog) source code is provided as the starting point for digital logic design.
Tool: Yosys performs synthesis to generate a gate-level netlistâ€”essentially a mapping from RTL logic to basic gates
